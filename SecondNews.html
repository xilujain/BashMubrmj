        <img src="image/header-image-2.png" id="image2" />
        <p id="news2p">The two-second rule, taught in driver's ed classes across the country, is a rule of thumb that helps drivers maintain a safe distance from the car ahead at any speed.</br>Adhering to the two-second rule can be difficult. A team of engineers led by Dan Work, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering, has developed an</br>assistive technology to help drivers maintain this guidance to smooth out traffic jams and improve safety.
        </br></br>A preprint of the article, "CAN Coach: Vehicular Control through Human Cyber-Physical Systems," was published by arXiv on April 8, and the paper was</br>presented at the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems during 2021 CPS-IOT Week May 18–21. Researchers on the project include</br>Matthew Nice, a current graduate student, and Jonathan Sprinkle, PhD'03, one of the School of Engineering's newest professors of computer science.
        </br></br>Work's team introduced a controller area network coach to cars—a system that gives real-time feedback to drivers using radar data containing speed and position</br>relative to the car ahead. Their goal was to see if they could use sensors already available within vehicles on the road to successfully help drivers maintain a safe</br>distance—in essence to drive in a way no human can do alone, said Work, who also is a 2021 Chancellor Faculty Fellow.
        </br></br>The technology was successful. By comparing six drivers with and without the CAN coach, the engineers determined that drivers with the assistive technology came</br>closer to and maintained the two-second rule. Drivers using the coach reduced the average time-gap error by 73 percent and improved consistency, reducing the</br>standard deviation of the time-gap error by 53 percent.
        </br></br>"We are now exploring how coached human drivers may ultimately help improve traffic conditions overall." Work's team intends to expand the experiments to</br> cohorts of drivers and is looking into creating systems that deliver personalized feedback that improves performance and minimizes intervention.
