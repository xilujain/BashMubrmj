        <h1 id="fourthheader-news">CODEX, AN AI SYSTEM THAT TRANSLATES NATURAL LANGUAGE TO PROGRAMMING CODE</h1>
        <img src="image/header-image-6.png" id="image6" />
        <p id="news4p">Artificial Intelligence research company OpenAI has announced the development of an AI system that translates natural language to programming code—called</br>Codex, the system is being released as a free API, at least for the time being.
        </br></br>Codex is more of a next-step product for OpenAI, rather than something completely new. It builds on Copilot, a tool for use with Microsoft's GitHub code repository.</br>With the earlier product, users would get suggestions similar to those seen in autocomplete in Google, except it would help finish lines of code. Codex has taken that</br>concept a huge step forward by accepting sentences written in English and translating them into runnable code. As an example, a user could ask the system to create</br> a web page with a certain name at the top and with four evenly sized panels below numbered one through four. Codex would then attempt to create the page by</br>generating the code necessary for the creation of such a site in whatever language (JavaScript, Python, etc.) was deemed appropriate.</br></br>The user could then send additional English commands to build the website piece by piece.
        </br></br>Codex (and Copilot) parse written text using OpenAI's language generation model—it is able to both generate and parse code, which allowed users to use Copilot in</br>custom ways—one of those ways was to generate programming code that had been written by others for the GitHub repository. This led many of those who had</br>contributed to the project to accuse OpenAI of using their code for profit, a charge that could very well be levied against Codex, as well, as much of the code it</br>generates is simply copied from GitHub. Notably, OpenAI started out as a nonprofit entity in</br>2015 and changed to what it described as a "capped profit" entity in 2019—a move the company claimed would help it get more funding from investors.
        </br></br>On its announcement page, OpenAI says that it is releasing the API for Codex in a private beta to start and also notes that the company is inviting developers and</br>businesses to give it a try. They also note that as a general-purpose programming tool, Codex can be used for virtually any programing task.
